# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to Advent of Code 2019 in JavaScript

## Get Started

```bash
# get and set some AoC env vars
cat <<EOF >.env
COOKIE="your AoC cookie"
YEAR="year of AoC"
EOF
yarn install
# get input for day 1 (or any other day)
node ./get_input.js 1 > 1.in
```
I stole this setup and readme from @luiscarlin
